 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * This is a function which should be in libc in every Unix.  Grumble.
 * It basically replaces the strtok function because it is reentrant.
 * This tokenizes a string by returning the next token in a string and
 * punching a \0 on the first delimiter character past the token.  The
 * difference from strtok is that you pass in the address of a string
 * pointer which will be shifted allong the buffer being processed.
 * With strtok you passed in a 0L for subsequant calls.  Yeach.
 *
 * This will count the true number of delimiter characters in the string
 * and will return an empty token (one with \0 in the zeroth position)
 * if there are two delimiter characters in a row.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * char *tok, *str_p = "1,2,3, hello there ";
 *
 * while (1) { tok = strsep(&str_p, " ,"); if (tok == 0L) { break; } }
 *
 * strsep will return as tokens: "1", "2", "3", "", "hello", "there", "".
 * Notice the two empty "" tokens where there were two delimiter
 * characters in a row ", " and at the end of the string where there
 * was an extra delimiter character.  If you want to ignore these
 * tokens then add a test to see if the first character of the token
 * is \0.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *
 * Success - Pointer to the next delimited token in the string.
 *
 * Failure - 0L if there are no more tokens.
 *
 * ARGUMENTS:
 *
 * string_p - Pointer to a string pointer which will be searched for
 * delimiters.  \0's will be added to this buffer.
 *
 * delim - List of delimiter characters which separate our tokens.  It
 * does not have to remain constant through all calls across the same
 * string.
