Argv Library
************

Version 2.7.0 - February 2010

The argv library has been designed to handle the argument processing
needs of most Unix software and to provide a consistent usage framework
for user applications.

   The library is reasonably portable having been run successfully on at
least the following operating systems: AIX, BSDI, DG/UX, FreeBSD, HPUX,
Irix, Linux, MS-DOG, NeXT, OSF, Solaris, SunOS, Ultrix, Unixware, and
even Unicos on a Cray Y-MP.

   The package includes the library, configuration scripts, shell-script
utility application, test program, and extensive documentation (text,
texi, info, ps).  The library and its documentation are available online
at URL `http://256.com/sources/argv/'.  *Note How To Get::.

   I can be reached via my web page `http://256.com/gray/' with any
questions or feedback.  Please include the version number of the library
that you are using as well as your machine and operating system types.

   Gray Watson.

2.2 How to get the library.
===========================

The newest versions of the argv library are available on the web at
`http://256.com/sources/argv/'.

   The versions in this repository also include such files as a
postscript version of the manual and other large files which may not
have been included in the distribution you received.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the INSTALL file for building, installation, and quick-start notes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DOCUMENTATION:

Examine the argv.html file which contains the user-documentation for
the argv subsystem.  It currently is lacking and may contain incorrect
information but should be better than nothing.  A texinfo version of
the documentation is also provided with which you can generate
hardcopy output with the help of the texinfo.tex file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INCLUDING ARGV IN OTHER PROGRAMS:

You are free to distribute the source for the library in other program
distributions under the terms of the copyright.  You should only need
the argv.c, argv.h, and argv_loc.h files plus any part of compat.c as
necessary.  You should obey the Copyright notices and keep the headers
in each file.

Please inform me of situations where the library does not fit well
with your programs current argument processing facilities.
