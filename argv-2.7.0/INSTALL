2.3 Installing the Library
==========================

To configure, compile, and install the library, follow these steps
carefully.

  1. Type `sh ./configure' to configure the library.  You may want to
     first examine the `config.help' file for some information about
     configure.  Configure should generate the `Makefile' and some
     configuration files automatically.

     _NOTE_: It seems that some versions of tr (especially from HP-UX)
     don't understand `tr '[a-z]' '[A-Z]''.  Since configure uses tr
     often, you may need to either get GNU's tr (in their textutils
     package) or generate the `Makefile' and `conf.h' files by hand.

  2. You may want to examine the `Makefile' and `conf.h' files created
     by configure to make sure it did its job correctly.

  3. Typing `make' should be enough to build `libargv.a' and the
     `argv_shell' utility.  If it does not work, please send me some
     notes so future users can profit from your experiences.

     _NOTE_: The code is pretty dependent on a good ANSI-C compiler.  If
     the configure script gives the `WARNING' that you do not have an
     ANSI-C compiler, you may still be able to add some sort of option
     to your compiler to make it ANSI.  If there such is an option,
     please send it to the author so it can be added to the configure
     script.

  4. Typing `make tests' should build the `argv_t' test program.  This
     can be run and given arguments to test the various library
     features.

  5. Typing `make install' should install the `libargv.a' library in
     `/usr/local/lib', the `argv_shell' utility in `/usr/local/bin',
     and the `argv.info' documentation file in `/usr/local/info'.

     You may have specified a `--prefix=PATH' option to configure in
     which can `/usr/local' will have been replaced with `PATH'.


   See the Getting Started section to get up and running with the
library.  *Note Getting Started::.

2.4 Getting Started with the Library
====================================

This section should give you a quick idea on how to get going.

  1. Make sure you have the latest version of the library.  It is
     available on the web at `http://256.com/sources/argv/'.  *Note How
     To Get::.

  2. Follow the installation instructions on how to configure and make
     and install the library (i.e. type: `make install').  *Note
     Installation::.

  3. Examine the `argv_t.c' test program source to see an example of
     how to program with the library.  After adding the appropriate
     `argv_t' structure array to your main source file, you need to
     compile and link your programs with the library.

  4. The first time your program is run, the library makes a number of
     checks as to the validity of the argument structures being used.
     You may have to note and fix reported problems.

  5. Run your program with the `--usage' argument and voila.
